### What is Python?

* Python is a computer language used in various applications It was introduced by **Guido van Rossum** and is an open-source high-level and object-oriented language
    
* Python consists of vast libraries and frameworks like Django, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, etc.
    

### How to install Python

**For Windows:**

[Click he](https://www.python.org/downloads/)re to download Python on the Windows operating system

**For Linux:**

Open Terminal and type the below command to install the python

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install python3
```

### Task1:

1. Install Python in your respective OS, and check the version.
    
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
    
2. Read about different Data Types in Python.
    
    1. **Numeric Types:**
        
        * **int**: Represents integers, such as 1, -5, or 1000.
            
        * **float**: Represents floating-point numbers, which are numbers with a decimal point, like 3.14 or -0.5.
            
        * **complex**: Represents complex numbers in the form `a + bj`, where `a` and `b` are floats, and `j` represents the square root of -1 (e.g., `3 + 2j`).
            
    2. **Sequence Types:**
        
        * **str**: Represents strings of characters, like "Hello, World!" or 'Python'.
            
        * **list**: Represents ordered, mutable (changeable) sequences of objects. Lists are created using square brackets, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.
            
        * **tuple**: Represents ordered, immutable (unchangeable) sequences of objects. Tuples are created using parentheses, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`.
            
    3. **Mapping Type:**
        
        * **dict**: Represents a dictionary, which is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are created using curly braces with key-value pairs, e.g., `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`.
            
    4. **Set Types:**
        
        * **set**: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are created using curly braces or the `set()` constructor, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}` or `set([1, 2, 2, 3])`.
            
        * **frozenset**: Similar to a set but is immutable. Once created, you cannot modify its contents.
            
    5. **Boolean Type:**
        
        * **bool**: Represents a Boolean value, which can be either `True` or `False`. It's often used for conditional statements and logical operations.
            
    6. **None Type:**
        
        * **None**: Represents the absence of a value. It is often used to indicate the absence of a return value in functions or methods.
            
    7. **Binary Types:**
        
        * **bytes**: Represents a sequence of bytes, similar to a string but immutable. It's often used for working with binary data.
            
        * **bytearray**: Similar to bytes but mutable.
            
    8. **Iterator Types:**
        
        * **iterable**: Represents any object capable of returning its elements one at a time. Common iterable types include lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings.
            
        * **iterator**: Represents an object that implements the iterator protocol, allowing you to loop over its elements using a `for` loop or the `next()` function.
            
    9. **Custom Classes:**
        
        * Python also allows you to define your own custom data types using classes. You can create objects with attributes and methods to represent complex data structures.
