# **What is Linux?**

Linux is a free and open-source operating system (OS) that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is based on the Unix operating system.

Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility.

There are many different versions of Linux, known as “distributions,” each with its own unique features and capabilities. Some of the most popular distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

# **Command to use present working directory :**

The “pwd” command stands for “print working directory.” It is used to display the full path of the current working directory.

# **Command to list files and directories with hidden files :**

`ls` is a command that is used to list the files and directories in a directory. The `-la` option tells `ls` to display the files in a long format and include hidden files.

#ls -la

# **Create a nested directory A/B/C/D/E :**

The command to create a nested directory is mkdir -p A/B/C/D/E. The -p switch creates parents’ directories.

* Discuss commands like `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` for creating, copying, moving, and deleting files.
    
* Provide examples of how these commands can be used to manage files effectively.
    

### **File Permissions and Ownership**

* Explain the concept of file permissions and ownership in Linux.
    
* Describe commands like `chmod` and `chown` to modify permissions and ownership of files.
    
* Offer insights on best practices for securing files and directories.
    

### **Text Manipulation**

* Introduce commands like `cat`, `grep`, `head`, and `tail` for working with text files.
    
* Provide examples of how these commands can be used to search for specific content, display the beginning or end of a file, or combine multiple files.
    

### **Process Management**
