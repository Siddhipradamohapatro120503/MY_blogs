## What is Kernel

The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computerâ€™s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.

## What is Shell

A shell is a special user program which provides an interface for the user to use operating system services. Shell accepts human-readable commands from a user and converts them into something which the kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.

## What is Linux Shell Scripting?

A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Linux shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

**Tasks**

### Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.

  
Shell scripting for **DevOps** is all about ðŸ¤– **automating** and **orchestrating** tasks and processes in a DevOps environment using ðŸ“œ shell scripts. It involves writing scripts in shell programming languages (such as **Bash**, **PowerShell**, or **Python**) to streamline repetitive tasks, enable process automation, and facilitate the integration and deployment of software. ðŸš€

### What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?ðŸ˜’

The line "**#!/bin/bash**" is known as a shebang or hashbang. It is commonly placed at the beginning of a shell script file and specifies the interpreter to be used to execute the script. In this case, "**/bin/bash**" indicates that the script should be interpreted and executed by the Bash shell.

**<mark>Bash (Bourne Again Shell)</mark>** is a popular and feature-rich shell that is commonly used as the default shell on many Linux distributions. It is **backwards-compatible** with the original Bourne shell (/bin/sh) and provides additional functionality and improvements.

Now, regarding the use of "**#!/bin/sh**," it specifies the Bourne shell as the interpreter for the script. The Bourne shell is an older shell that lacks some of the advanced features and capabilities found in Bash. However, it is more lightweight and is still available on most Unix-like systems.

* ### Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge`
    

```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "I will Complete #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge"
```

First, create a file using touch Challenge.sh

Then `vi Challenge.sh`

Press `I` on the keyboard to insert

Write you content

Press the **esc Key** on the keyboard

Write `:wq` press enter to save and quit Vim

Give permission to file the **execute** using `chmod -x Challenge.sh`

At last type `./Challenge.sh`

* ### Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.

* ### Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers
    

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Compare two numbers
num1=10
num2=20

if [ $num1 -eq $num2 ]; then
    echo "The numbers are equal."
elif [ $num1 -gt $num2 ]; then
    echo "Number 1 is greater than Number 2."
else
    echo "Number 2 is greater than Number 1."
fi
```
